## Copying down to local machine
We off load wp-content/uploads to AWS using WPEngine's LargeFS
Sometimes we create a clone of a server for development and need to also copy the images
[AWS's documentation ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/cp.html)


- Create a directory to store the files `mkdir s3-files`
- Navigate to that file 



`$ aws s3 cp s3://bucket/folder/file.txt `
